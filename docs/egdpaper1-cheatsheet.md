EGD Paper 1 — Cheat Sheet (Quick Reference)

Author: Samson Chrizeecry Senyatsi — Technical Mastery Academy
Purpose: Fast, printable guide for Grade 12 EGD Paper 1 practice and exam technique.

1 — Exam Mindset & Timing
- Paper 1 structure: technical drawing problems; aim for clarity over speed.
- Time management: 120 minutes total. Break down by question count (e.g., 4 questions → 30 min each).
- Begin with the easiest questions to secure marks. Attempt all questions.

2 — Tools & Setup
- Use HB pencil for construction, 2H for final lines, 0.5mm mechanical for details.
- Scale rule, 30/60 set square, protractor, compass, T-square.
- Keep all construction lines light; final lines bold and clean.

3 — Common Drawing Steps (repeat for each problem)
- Read the whole question fully (60 seconds).
- Annotate known dimensions and constraints on the drawing.
- Establish datum line / baseline and orientation.
- Block out main shapes first (skeleton) — rectangles, circles, key angles.
- Add construction lines (centerlines, projection lines) and show measurements.
- Finalize with line weights: thick for outlines, thin for details, dashed for hidden.

4 — Key Geometry Tips
- For tangency: draw radii to tangent point; radius lines meet at center.
- For parallel offsets: use set square + scale rule; mark consistently.
- For similar triangles: use proportional relationships to find dimensions.
- For perpendicular bisector: bisect the segment with compass arcs, join intersection.

5 — Scale & Measurements
- Always write the scale used on the drawing (e.g., 1:50).
- Convert carefully: 1:50 means 1 unit on paper = 50 units in reality.
- Use the scale rule; avoid freehand measurement conversions.

6 — Technical Presentation
- Title block: name, date, paper, scale, question number.
- Dimensioning: show units, use arrows, avoid crossing dimension lines.
- Notes: label materials or finishes if asked.

7 — Frequent Mistakes (avoid these)
- Rushing the initial reading — misread constraints.
- Over-dark construction lines — makes drawing messy.
- Missing scale annotation or wrong conversion.
- Ignoring small marks for alignment (causes cumulative error).

8 — Quick Reference Formulas
- Right triangle: sinθ = opp/hyp, cosθ = adj/hyp, tanθ = opp/adj
- Pythagoras: a² + b² = c²
- Circle circumference: C = 2πr, Area: A = πr²

9 — PAT Practical Tips
- Practice with past PAT papers under timed conditions.
- Record recurring question types and make templates.
- Keep a "problem checklist" (Read → Annotate → Skeleton → Construct → Finalize).

10 — Practice Problems (do these weekly)
- Problem A: Construct a tangent from external point to circle. Show construction arcs and center.
- Problem B: Draw isometric projection of given orthographic view (practice orientation first).
- Problem C: Set out a simple truss elevation with correct joint labeling and dimensions.

11 — Short Study Routine (30 minutes/day)
- 10 min: Review one past question solution and annotations.
- 15 min: Re-draw the problem focusing on cleaner presentation.
- 5 min: Self-check against marking rubric.
